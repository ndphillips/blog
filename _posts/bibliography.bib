                  judgment and decision-making research. His

                  Clinical versus Statistical Prediction: A
                  Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence
                  (1954) is known as an attack on human judgment and a
                  call for replacing clinicians with actuarial
                  methods. More than 40 years later, fast and frugal
                  heuristics—proposed as models of human judgment—were
                  formalized, tested, and found to be surprisingly
                  accurate, often more so than the actuarial models
                  that Meehl advocated. We ask three questions: Do the
                  findings of the two programs contradict each other?
                  More generally, how are the programs conceptually
                  connected? Is there anything they can learn from
                  each other? After demonstrating that there need not
                  be a contradiction, we show that both programs
                  converge in their concern to develop (a)
                  domain-specific models of judgment and (b) nonlinear
                  process models that arise from the bounded nature of
                  judgment. We then elaborate the differences between
                  the programs and discuss how these differences can
                  be viewed as mutually instructive: First, we show
                  that the fast and frugal heuristic models can help
                  bridge the clinical—actuarial divide, that is, they
                  can be developed into actuarial methods that are
                  both accurate and easy to implement by the unaided
                  clinical judge. We then argue that Meehl's
                  insistence on improving judgment makes clear the
                  importance of examining the degree to which
                  heuristics are used in the clinical domain and how
                  acceptable they would be as actuarial tools.}

  abstract={The general problem of forming composite variables from
                  components is prevalent in many types of research. A
                  major aspect of this problem is the weighting of
                  components. Assuming that composites are a linear
                  function of their components, composites formed by
                  using standard linear regression are compared to
                  those formed by simple unit weighting schemes, i.e.,
                  where predictor variables are weighted by 1.0. The
                  degree of similarity between the two composites,
                  expressed as the minimum possible correlation
                  between them, is derived. This minimum correlation
                  is found to be an increasing function of the
                  intercorrelation of the components and a decreasing
                  function of the number of predictors. Moreover, the
                  minimum is fairly high for most applied
                  situations. The predictive ability of the two
                  methods is compared. For predictive purposes, unit
                  weighting is a viable alternative to standard
                  regression methods because unit weights: (1) are not
                  estimated from the data and therefore do not
                  “consume” degrees of freedom; (2) are “estimated”
                  without error (i.e., they have no standard errors);
                  (3) cannot reverse the “true” relative weights of
                  the variables. Predictive ability of the two methods
                  is examined as a function of sample size and number
                  of predictors. It is shown that unit weighting will
                  be superior to regression in certain situations and
                  not greatly inferior in others. Various implications
                  for using unit weighting are discussed and
                  applications to several decision making situations
                  are illustrated.}

                  variables are given weights such that the resulting
                  linear composite optimally predicts some criterion

                  standard regression analysis, discriminant function
                  analysis, and ridge regression analysis. Research
                  summarized in P. Meehl's (1954) book on clinical vs
                  statistical prediction and research stimulated in
                  part by that book indicate that when a numerical
                  criterion variable (e.g., graduate GPA) is to be
                  predicted from numerical predictor variables, proper
                  linear models outperform clinical
                  intuition. Improper linear models are those in which
                  the weights of the predictor variables are obtained
                  by some nonoptimal method. The present article
                  presents evidence that even such improper linear

                  predicting a numerical criterion from numerical
                  predictors. In fact, unit (i.e., equal) weighting is
                  quite robust for making such predictions. The
                  application of unit weights to decide what bullet
                  the Denver Police Department should use is
                  described; some technical, psychological, and
                  ethical resistances to using linear models in making
                  social decisions are considered; and arguments that
                  could weaken these resistances are presented.}

Resolution of debates in cognition usually comes from the introduction of constraints in the form of new data about either the process or representation. Decision research, in contrast, has relied predominantly on testing models by examining their fit to choices. The authors examine a recently proposed choice strategy, the priority heuristic, which provides a novel account of how people make risky choices. The authors identify a number of properties that the priority heuristic should have as a process model and illustrate how they may be tested. The results, along with prior research, suggest that although the priority heuristic captures some variability in the attention paid to outcomes, it fails to account for major characteristics of the data, particularly the frequent transitions between outcomes and their probabilities. The article concludes with a discussion of the properties that should be captured by process models of risky choice and the role of process data in theory development.},

                  flexibility of the theory (how much it cannot fit),
                  the variability of the data (how firmly the data
                  rule out what the theory cannot fit), or the
                  likelihood of other outcomes (perhaps the theory
                  could have fit any plausible result), and a reader
                  needs all 3 pieces of information to decide how much
                  the fit should increase belief in the theory. The
                  use of good fits as evidence is not supported by
                  philosophers of science nor by the history of
                  psychology; there seem to be no examples of a theory
                  supported mainly by good fits that has led to
                  demonstrable progress. A better way to test a theory
                  with free parameters is to determine how the theory
                  constrains possible outcomes (i.e., what it
                  predicts), assess how firmly actual outcomes agree
                  with those constraints, and determine if plausible
                  alternative outcomes would have been inconsistent
                  with the theory, allowing for the variability of the
                  data.}

                  backpropagation are examples of nonparametric

                  nonparametric inference and its relation to neural

                  highlight strengths and weaknesses of neural

  abstract={Models of decision making are distinguished by those that
                  aim for an optimal solution in a world that is
                  precisely specified by a set of assumptions (a
                  so-called “small world”) and those that aim for a
                  simple but satisfactory solution in an uncertain
                  world where the assumptions of optimization models
                  may not be met (a so-called “large world”). Few
                  connections have been drawn between these 2 families
                  of models. In this study, the authors show how
                  psychological concepts originating in the classic
                  signal-detection theory (SDT), a small-world
                  approach to decision making, can be used to
                  understand the workings of a class of simple models
                  known as fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). Results
                  indicate that (a) the setting of the subjective
                  decision criterion in SDT corresponds directly to
                  the choice of exit structure in an FFT; (b) the
                  sensitivity of an FFT (measured in d′) is reflected
                  by the order of cues searched and the properties of
                  cues in an FFT, including the mean and variance of
                  cues' individual d′s, the intercue correlation, and
                  the number of cues; and (c) compared with the ideal
                  and the optimal sequential sampling models in SDT
                  and a majority model with an information search
                  component, FFTs are extremely frugal (i.e., do not
                  search for much cue information), highly robust, and
                  well adapted to the payoff structure of a
                  task. These findings demonstrate the potential of
                  theory integration in understanding the common
                  underlying psychological structures of apparently
                  disparate theories of cognition.}

  abstract = {We distinguish between situations of risk, where all
                  options, consequences, and probabilities are known,
                  and situations of uncertainty, where they are
                  not. Probability theory and statistics are the best
                  tools for deciding under risk but not under
                  uncertainty, which characterizes most relevant
                  problems that humans have to solve. Uncertainty
                  requires simple heuristics that are robust rather
                  than optimal. We propose to think of the mind as an
                  adaptive toolbox and introduce the descriptive study
                  of heuristics, their building blocks, and the core
                  capacities they exploit. The question of which
                  heuristic to select for which class of problems is
                  the topic of the normative study of ecological
                  rationality. We discuss earlier views on the nature
                  of heuristics that maintained that heuristics are
                  always less accurate because they ignore information
                  and demand less effort. Contrary to this
                  accuracy-effort trade-off view, heuristics can lead
                  to more accurate inferences — under uncertainty — than
                  strategies that use more information and
                  computation. The study of heuristics opens up a new
                  perspective on the nature of both cognition and
                  rationality. In a world of uncertainty, Homo sapiens
                  might well be called Homo heuristicus.},

                  introduced and a tutorial-style example application
                  (threat assessment at military checkpoints) is
                  provided. Throughout, we discuss ways to deal with
                  missing or incomplete data and show that the
                  performance of decision aids may be overestimated if
                  the effectiveness of actions is not heeded. The
                  methodology can be used to construct and evaluate
                  decision aids in any area characterised by
                  dichotomised cues and a one-to-many mapping between

                  decisions that (i) rely on core psychological
                  capacities (e.g., recognizing patterns or recalling
                  information from memory), (ii) do not necessarily
                  use all available information, and process the
                  information they use by simple computations (e.g.,
                  ordinal comparisons or un-weighted sums), and (iii)
                  are easy to understand, apply and explain. The
                  contribution of this article is fourfold: First, the
                  conceptual foundation of the psychological
                  heuristics research program is provided, along with
                  a discussion of its relationship to soft and hard
                  OR. Second, empirical evidence and theoretical
                  analyses are presented on the conditions under which
                  psychological heuristics perform on par with or even
                  better than more complex standard models in decision
                  problems such as multi-attribute choice,
                  classification, and forecasting, and in domains as
                  varied as health, economics and management. Third,
                  we demonstrate the application of the psychological
                  heuristics approach to the problem of reducing
                  civilian casualties in military stability
                  operations. Finally, we discuss the role that
                  psychological heuristics can play in OR theory and

  abstract={Humans and animals make inferences about the world under
                  limited time and knowledge. In contrast, many models
                  of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean
                  Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge, and
                  computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of
                  satisficing, the authors have proposed a family of
                  algorithms based on a simple psychological
                  mechanism: one-reason decision making. These fast
                  and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of
                  classical rationality: They neither look up nor
                  integrate all information. By computer simulation,
                  the authors held a competition between the
                  satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm and various
                  "rational" inference procedures (e.g., multiple
                  regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or
                  outperformed all competitors in inferential speed
                  and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that
                  cognitive mechanisms capable of successful
                  performance in the real world do not need to satisfy
                  the classical norms of rational inference.}

  abstract = {To function well in an unpredictable environment using
                  unreliable components, a system must have a high
                  degree of robustness. Robustness is fundamental to
                  biological systems and is an objective in the design
                  of engineered systems such as airplane engines and
                  buildings. Cognitive systems, like biological and
                  engineered systems, exist within variable
                  environments. This raises the question, how do
                  cognitive systems achieve similarly high degrees of
                  robustness? The aim of this study was to identify a
                  set of mechanisms that enhance robustness in
                  cognitive systems. We identify three mechanisms that
                  enhance robustness in biological and engineered
                  systems: system control, redundancy, and
                  adaptability. After surveying the psychological
                  literature for evidence of these mechanisms, we
                  provide simulations illustrating how each
                  contributes to robust cognition in a different
                  psychological domain: psychomotor vigilance,
                  semantic memory, and strategy selection. These
                  simulations highlight features of a mathematical
                  approach for quantifying robustness, and they

  abstract={Simple lexicographic decision heuristics that consider
                  cues one at a time in a particular order and stop
                  searching for cues as soon as a decision can be made
                  have been shown to be both accurate and frugal in
                  their use of information.  But much of the
                  simplicity and success of these heuristics comes
                  from using an appropriate cue order.  For instance,
                  the Take The Best heuristic uses validity order for
                  cues, which requires considerable computation,
                  potentially undermining the computational advantages
                  of the simple decision mechanism.  But many cue
                  orders can achieve good decision performance, and
                  studies of sequential search for data records have
                  proposed a number of simple ordering rules that may
                  be of use in constructing appropriate decision cue
                  orders as well.  Here we consider a range of simple
                  cue ordering mechanisms, including tallying,
                  swapping, and move-to-front rules, and show that
                  they can find cue orders that lead to reasonable
                  accuracy and considerable frugality when used with
                  lexicographic decision heuristics.},
